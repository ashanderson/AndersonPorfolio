# Final Project
## Part I
### Outline
This project will create a visualization of all Notices of Intent to Repatriate from the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act by state from 1995 through 2019.  This data will then be compared to the data of all federally recognized tribes in the United States and draw conclusions of the number of repatriation claims by tribe. The goal of this project is to have the audience understand trends in repatriation over the past 25 years and come away with a sense of advocacy for the cultural ethics and policy surrounding these issues. 
This goal will be accomplished through this story arc:
Setup - The destruction and 
Conflict - 
Resolution - Repatriation is a step toward creating a new narrative that underscores a shared cultural heritage


### Data
[Indian Lands and Native Entities, Open-source Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/indian-lands-and-native-entities)

[NAGPRA](https://www.nps.gov/nagpra/FED_NOTICES/NAGPRADIR/index2.htm)
[Data from NAGPRA](NAGPRA_Data.md)

### Method and Medium
I will have to use a variety of programs to create my visualization. First, I will need to use OpenRefine to clean the two datasets and possibly add attributes to reflect what I want to show. Second, I will be using Infogram to build the wireframing and storyboards, and ultimately using Shorthand or Storymaps to present my project. My goal is to create a time-lapse map of repatriations over the past 25 years as well as a supporting graph to show to which tribes are the majority of repatriations over the 25 year period.
