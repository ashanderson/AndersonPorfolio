# Final Project
## Part I
### Outline
This project will create a visualization of all Notices of Intent to Repatriate from the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act by state from 1995 through 2019.  This data will then be compared to the data of all federally recognized tribes in the United States and draw conclusions of the number of repatriation claims by tribe.
