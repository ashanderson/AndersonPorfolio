Draft Environmental Impact Statement and General Management Plan; San Juan Island National Historical Park, San Juan County, WA; Notice of Availability	Notice	Interior Department; National Park Service	Pursuant to Sec. 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, as amended), and the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Part 1500-1508), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the proposed General Management Plan (GMP) for San Juan Island National Historical Park located in San Juan County, Washington. This DEIS describes and analyzes three GMP alternatives that respond to both NPS planning requirements and to the public's concerns and issues, identified during the scoping and early public involvement process. Each alternative presents management strategies for resource protection and preservation, education and interpretation, visitor use and facilities, land protection and boundaries, and long-term operations and management of the park. The potential environmental consequences of all the alternatives, and mitigation strategies, are identified and analyzed in the DEIS. In addition to a baseline ``no-action'' alternative, an ``environmentally preferred'' alternative is identified. Background: A Notice of Intent formally initiating the conservation planning and environmental impact analysis effort necessary for updating the general management plan was published in the Federal Register on February 5, 2003. The National Park Service (NPS) organized an interdisciplinary planning team consisting of staff at San Juan Island National Historical Park and the NPS Pacific West Regional Office in Seattle, Washington to identify preliminary issues to be addressed in updating the GMP. The last GMP was prepared in 1979. The official public scoping process began in March 2003 when the NPS produced and distributed an initial newsletter announcing the start of the planning process and soliciting feedback on issues to be addressed in the plan. The newsletter was mailed to the park's 216 person mailing list, and also posted on the park's website. In addition, 4,000 copies of the newsletter were inserted into The Journal of the San Juan Islands newspaper, which reaches approximately 3,000 island residents and approximately 1,000 residents off-island. An additional 2,500 copies were distributed to area libraries, civic buildings, business, churches, museums, universities, communities, dignitaries and elected officials. Three public workshops were held in April 2003, with two in Friday Harbor, Washington, and one in Seattle, Washington. Presentations about the mission of the NPS and purpose and significance of San Juan Island national Historical Park were followed by small group work sessions that allowed people to present and discuss issues, experiences, and ideas for the park. Approximately thirty-nine people attended the San Juan Island workshops, and an additional four participated in the Seattle workshop. Eighteen written responses were also collected during the scoping period. A second newsletter was produced in November 2003 summarizing the comments received, written and oral, during the scoping period. The comments covered a broad range of issues, concerns, personal experiences, and recommendations for the park. When compiled, over 224 different comments or ideas were represented. The comments can be broadly organized in the following topics: Resource preservation and management; visitor experience and services; park facilities, operations, management and maintenance, and park administration and planning. Though many new actions and ideas were suggested by the public during this comment period, no new issues were identified. Proposed Plan and Alternatives: Alternative A constitutes the ``baseline'' No Action Alternative and assumes a continuation of existing management and trends at San Juan Island National Historical Park. The primary emphasis would continue to be placed on protection and preservation of cultural resources. Since 1966, the park has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. Management of cultural landscapes around the immediate encampment areas at American Camp and English Camp would continue to emphasize cultural landscape management while respecting the natural environment and natural processes. No new construction would be authorized. Alternative B would increase visitor opportunities and outreach at both English Camp and American Camp, as well as in the town of Friday Harbor, through additional visitor facilities, recreational opportunities, programs, and services. Natural and cultural resources interpretation would be enhanced through more extensive facilities and programs. Off-island interpretation would be enhanced through partnerships. The park would propose boundary adjustments at both camps to include important natural and cultural resources related to the purpose of the park. At English Camp, the road system would be reconfigured as a one-way loop road by connecting a road segment approximately one-fifth mile long from the entrance road to the administrative road. The road would follow the existing historic road alignment where possible. The Crook house would be rehabilitated as a visitor contact facility on the ground floor and for administrative use on the second floor. At American Camp, the 1979 double-wide trailer that serves as the temporary visitor center at American Camp would be removed, the site restored to natural conditions, and a new enlarged visitor center would be constructed north of the redoubt. The new visitor center would include space for a collections study room for natural and cultural resource items, including a portion of the military-era collections. The existing road to the redoubt off Pickett's Lane would be removed and converted to a trail. The cultural landscapes would be enhanced to aid visitor understanding and interpretation through a variety of techniques. The prairie would be restored to native plant species. Alternative C is the NPS Preferred Alternative and would broaden the scope of resource management and interpretation programs to emphasize the connections and interrelationships between the park's natural and cultural resources. New facilities, trails and programs would provide opportunities for visitors to understand the importance of the park's natural resources in defining the cultural landscapes and influencing the settlement and historic events of San Juan Island. At English Camp, the Crook house would be retained, stabilized, and used as an exterior exhibit while the hospital would be rehabilitated and opened to the public for interpretation. The 1979 double-wide trailer that serves as the temporary visitor center at American Camp would be removed and replaced with a permanent, enlarged visitor center at the existing site, allowing for improved exhibits and staff space. A collections study room for natural and cultural resource items, including a portion of the military-era collections would be relocated to the park. Additional buildings would be open to the public for interpretation as well as research and academic study. As in Alternative B, the existing road to the redoubt would be removed and converted to a trail and the prairie would be restored to native plant species. Historic buildings from the encampment period still existing on the island would be repatriated back to their original locations within the camps. Off- island interpretation would be enhanced through partnerships. The park would propose boundary adjustments at both camps to include important natural and cultural resources related to the purpose of the park. As documented in the DEIS, Alternative C is deemed to be the ``environmentally preferred'' alternative. Public Review and Comment: The DEIS/GMP is now available for public review. All written comments must be postmarked or transmitted not later than 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register of the EPA's notice of filing of the EIS; as soon as this date is confirmed, it will be announced on the project website and via local and regional media.

Intent To Prepare a Joint Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report for the Reintroduction of the Riparian Brush Rabbit	Notice	Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service	The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and the Endangered Species Recovery Program (ESRP) through California State University, Stanislaus, propose to participate in the reintroduction of the riparian brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani riparius), which is federally listed as endangered, to restored riparian habitat. The strategy for the conservation (i.e. recovery) of the riparian brush rabbit was published in the Recovery Plan for the Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998). This recovery plan outlines research and management actions necessary to support recovery of the species. It is the intent of the Service to recover federally listed species through actions which will lead to the maintenance of secure, self-sustaining wild populations of species with the minimum necessary investment of resources. In the case of a species as at risk of extinction as the riparian brush rabbit, efforts necessary to bring about recovery often require extraordinary measures. Because of the small size of remaining blocks of potential habitat, and the severely limited dispersal capability of the riparian brush rabbit, the brush rabbit is likely to require continuing special protection of its habitat and population. More specifically, captive breeding is needed to increase riparian brush rabbit numbers and preserve genetic diversity. Additionally, the release of their progeny will be needed to enhance existing populations as necessary and to establish reintroduced populations within the historic range. The action proposed in this Notice of Intent, the reintroduction of riparian brush rabbits to restored riparian habitat, is considered a beneficial action. The Service does, however, recognize that there may be impacts to the human environment associated with reintroduction. This notice describes the proposed action and possible alternatives, invites public participation in the scoping process for preparing the joint Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report, solicits written comments, and identifies the Service Official to whom questions and comments concerning the proposed action and the Environmental Impact Statement may be directed.	 00-17986	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/07/28/00-17986/intent-to-prepare-a-joint-environmental-impact-statementenvironmental-impact-report-for-the	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-07-28/pdf/00-17986.pdf	7/28/00

Final Environmental Impact Statement and General Management Plan; San Juan Island National Historical Park, San Juan County, WA; Notice of Availability	Notice	Interior Department; National Park Service	Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, as amended), and the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Part 1500-1508), the National Park Service (NPS), Department of the Interior, has prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for updating the General Management Plan (GMP) for San Juan Island National Historical Park located in San Juan County, Washington. The current GMP was prepared in 1979. This FEIS describes and analyzes three GMP alternatives that respond to both NPS planning requirements and to the public's concerns and issues, identified during the scoping and public involvement process. Each alternative presents management strategies for resource protection and preservation, education and interpretation, visitor use and facilities, land protection and boundaries, and long-term operations and management of the park. The potential environmental consequences of all the alternatives, and mitigation strategies, are identified and analyzed in the FEIS. In addition to a ``no-action'' alternative, an ``environmentally preferred'' alternative is identified. Proposed Plan and Alternatives: Alternative A constitutes the ``no- action'' alternative and assumes a continuation of existing management and trends at San Juan Island National Historical Park. The primary emphasis in current management is placed on the protection and preservation of cultural resources. Since 1966, the park has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. The management of cultural landscapes around the immediate encampment areas at American Camp and English Camp would continue to emphasize cultural landscape management while respecting the natural environment and natural processes. No new construction would be authorized. Alternative B would increase visitor opportunities and outreach at both English Camp and American Camp, as well as in the town of Friday Harbor through additional visitor facilities, recreational opportunities, programs, and services. Natural and cultural resources interpretation would be enhanced through more extensive facilities and programs. At English Camp, the road system would be reconfigured as a one-way loop road by connecting a road segment approximately one-fifth mile long from the entrance road to the administrative road. The road would follow the existing historic road alignment where possible. The Crook house would be rehabilitated as a visitor contact facility on the ground floor and for administrative use on the second floor. At American Camp, the 1979 double-wide trailer that serves as the temporary visitor center at American Camp would be removed, the site restored to natural conditions, and a new enlarged visitor center would be constructed north of the redoubt. The new visitor center would include space for a collections study room for natural and cultural resource items, including a portion of the military-era collections. The existing road to the redoubt off Pickett's Lane would be removed and converted to a trail. The cultural landscapes would be enhanced to aid visitor understanding and interpretation through a variety of techniques. The prairie would be restored to native plant species. Off- island interpretation would be enhanced through partnerships. The park would propose boundary adjustments at both sites to include important natural and cultural resources related to the purpose of the park. Alternative C is the agency-preferred alternative as it would broaden the scope of resource management and interpretation programs to emphasize connections and interrelationships between the park's natural and cultural resources. New facilities, trails and programs provide opportunities for visitors to understand the importance of the park's natural resources in defining the cultural landscapes and influencing the settlement and historic events of San Juan Island. At English Camp, the Crook house would be retained, stabilized, and used as an exterior exhibit while the hospital would be rehabilitated and opened to the public for interpretation. The 1979 double-wide trailer that serves as the temporary visitor center at American Camp would be removed and replaced with a permanent, enlarged visitor center at the existing site, allowing for improved exhibits and staff space. A collections study room for natural and cultural resource items, including a portion of the military-era collections would be relocated to the park. Additional buildings would be open to the public for interpretation as well as research and academic study. As in Alternative B, the existing road to the redoubt would be removed and converted to a trail and the prairie would be restored to native plant species. Historic buildings from the encampment period still existing on the island would be repatriated back to their original locations within the camps. Off-island interpretation would be enhanced through partnerships. Finally, the park would also propose adjusting the boundary at both sites to include important natural and cultural resources related to the purpose of the park. Alternative C is deemed to be the ``environmentally preferred'' alternative.

Proposed Revisions to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mitigation Policy	Notice	Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service	We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce proposed revisions to our Mitigation Policy, which has guided Service recommendations on mitigating the adverse impacts of land and water developments on fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats since 1981. The revisions are motivated by changes in conservation challenges and practices since 1981, including accelerating loss of habitats, effects of climate change, and advances in conservation science. The revised policy provides a framework for applying a landscape-scale approach to achieve, through application of the mitigation hierarchy, a net gain in conservation outcomes, or at a minimum, no net loss of resources and their values, services, and functions resulting from proposed actions. The primary intent of the policy is to apply mitigation in a strategic manner that ensures an effective linkage with conservation strategies at appropriate landscape scales. We request comments, information, and recommendations from governmental agencies, Indian Tribes, the scientific community, industry groups, environmental interest groups, and any other interested parties.	 2016-05142	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/08/2016-05142/proposed-revisions-to-the-us-fish-and-wildlife-service-mitigation-policy	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-03-08/pdf/2016-05142.pdf	3/8/16

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee Findings Related to the Identity of Cultural Items in the Possession of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY	Notice	Interior Department; National Park Service	The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) was established by section 8 of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA; 25 U.S.C. 3006), and is an advisory body governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C. 1-16). At its October 30-31, 2009, public meeting in Sarasota, FL, the Review Committee, acting pursuant to its statutory responsibility (25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(3)), reviewed the record and made findings of fact related to the identity of 45 cultural items in the possession of the American Museum of Natural History at the request of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and the White Mountain Apache Tribe, acting through the Western Apache NAGPRA Working Group. The Review Committee found that each of the 45 cultural items was both a ``sacred object'' (25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), 43 CFR 10.2(d)(3)) and ``cultural patrimony'' (25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), 43 CFR 10.2(d)(4)).	 2010-7936	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/04/08/2010-7936/native-american-graves-protection-and-repatriation-review-committee-findings-related-to-the-identity	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-04-08/pdf/2010-7936.pdf	4/8/10

Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs; Secondary School Student Sponsor On-Site Reviews	Notice	State Department	The Department has designated United States organizations to conduct Secondary School Student exchange programs since 1949, following passage of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and adoption of 22 CFR part 62--Exchange Visitor Program regulations (14 FR 4592, July 22, 1949). Over the last 60 years, more than 850,000 foreign exchange students have lived in and learned about America through these Secondary School Student programs. Educational and cultural exchanges are the cornerstone of U.S. public diplomacy and an integral component of American foreign policy. Secondary School Student exchange programs promote mutual understanding by providing foreign students the opportunity to study in American high schools while living with American host families. Not only are the students themselves positively transformed and enriched by these experiences, but so too are their families, friends, and teachers in their home countries. Globalization and the changing demographics of potential American host families, however, are having an impact on the traditional Secondary School Student exchange model. As a result, the Department has taken steps over the past several years to clarify and amend existing regulations; identify program issues that require further attention; cap program growth; more closely monitor sponsor performance; evaluate sponsor compliance; and, when necessary, impose administrative sanctions up to an including the revocation of the sponsor's program designation. In addition to these efforts, the Department has determined that a comprehensive review of each individual designated sponsor organization and its business practices is necessary to assist the Department in meeting both its policy objectives and oversight obligations for this category of exchange. The review of individual designated sponsors is conducted under the Department's regulatory authorities set forth at 22 CFR part 62. Initially, the Department will conduct on-site reviews of all fee charging program sponsors. Excluded from this first round of review are all Rotary programs, schools, school districts, and government programs. Following the first round of on-site reviews, the Department will determine whether to conduct on-site reviews of some or all of the remaining non-fee-charging sponsors, or if a comparable review of these programs can be conducted through some alternative method. The Department intends to examine a broad range of sponsor operations. The process will encompass in-depth financial review; examination of program pricing structures; appraisal of organizational operating models; review of hiring criteria and training policies for program employees and agents; evaluation of third party contractor relationships; and standard operating procedures, especially those related to the screening and selection of host families and the repatriation of program participants. Other areas of review will include, but are not limited to, decision-making processes (including the numbers of students accepted); self-imposed compliance mechanisms; procedures for handling student problems; standards for the selection of housing with host families; and policies for refunding deposits or payments when applicants cannot participate due to visa denial or sponsor inability to secure a placement. The Department will also examine the relationships between sponsors and third parties, including foreign partners. In the case of foreign partners, the Department will review their role in the overall placement process and the fees they charge for their services. The Department will scrutinize all contractual relationships under which designated sponsors outsource ``core'' services, i.e., the screening, selection, placement, orientation, and monitoring functions that constitute the core elements of international exchange programming. It is the Department's intention that the burden of these reviews on sponsors will be minimal. Most document production will precede the on-site reviews and will involve standard and already existing business documents. The on-site portion of the review will entail interviews with key employees and review of files, but may also involve other follow-on areas of inquiry. Sponsors will be given at least ten business days' notice of the on-site review at which time they will be asked to submit required documentation within five business days. The Department will try to be flexible with scheduling of reviews to ensure the availability of the sponsor's responsible officer, alternate responsible officer(s), and other key employees who will need to be interviewed. Many of the reviews will be completed in two business days by two-person teams of Department employees from the Office of Designation and the Office of Exchange Coordination and Compliance. Individual circumstances, however, may result in the Department bringing additional staff or extending the length of the review. In addition, a representative from both the Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Grants Office and Youth Programs Division will join the review teams for those sponsors that place secondary school students under the terms of grant awards. These reviews will not replace the redesignation process nor alter the requirements that sponsors submit applications for redesignation prior to the expiration of their current designations. Nor will the reviews take the place of the annual data reports required by regulation. Following the reviews, the Department will compile and share best practices and lessons learned with the exchange community. The Department recognizes it may also find operations that require the imposition of corrective action plans, or it may find that some entities no longer meet the eligibility requirements necessary to retain their designations. The Department believes that these reviews will provide an opportunity for continued growth of the partnership between the Department and program sponsors necessary and that the reviews will further our shared goal of ensuring that these young and potentially vulnerable exchange program participants all return to their countries with fond and meaningful memories of their successful exchange adventure in the United States of America.	 2010-2266	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/02/03/2010-2266/bureau-of-educational-and-cultural-affairs-secondary-school-student-sponsor-on-site-reviews	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-02-03/pdf/2010-2266.pdf	2/3/10

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mitigation Policy	Notice	Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service	We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce revisions to our Mitigation Policy, which has guided Service recommendations on mitigating the adverse impacts of land and water developments on fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats since 1981. The revisions are motivated by changes in conservation challenges and practices since 1981, including accelerating loss of habitats, effects of climate change, and advances in conservation science. The revised Policy provides a framework for applying a landscape-scale approach to achieve, through application of the mitigation hierarchy, a net gain in conservation outcomes, or at a minimum, no net loss of resources and their values, services, and functions resulting from proposed actions. The primary intent of the Policy is to apply mitigation in a strategic manner that ensures an effective linkage with conservation strategies at appropriate landscape scales.	 2016-27751	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/21/2016-27751/us-fish-and-wildlife-service-mitigation-policy	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-11-21/pdf/2016-27751.pdf	11/21/16

Final Notice of Issuance, Reissuance, and Modification of Nationwide Permits	Notice	Final Notice of Issuance, Reissuance, and Modification of Nationwide; Defense Department; Army Department; Engineers Corps	The Corps of Engineers is reissuing the existing nationwide permits (NWP) and conditions, some with modifications, and issuing two new NWPs. As with all general permits, NWPs include specific project limitations which ensure that adverse effects will be no more than minimal and that the aquatic environment will be protected. At the same time, if a permit applicant can design a project in a way that meets the limitations of the NWP, the Corps will provide an expedited review and decision for the project. General permits, including NWPs, are an essential part of the Corps regulatory program, and provide us with the method we use to authorize 80% of the activities we regulate. An effective NWP program is essential to administration of the Corps regulatory program. The Corps, however, is increasingly aware of the concerns regarding the level of adverse effects being authorized by NWPs, particularly NWP 26. As a result, we have taken a critical look at the NWP program to better ensure that projects that truly have minimal impacts will continue to be authorized, while ensuring that only minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects will result from the Corps authorizing projects under the program. For example, we have made substantial changes to NWP 26, with an ultimate approach of more clearly defining the activities regulated through activity-specific replacement general permits. The interim changes to NWP 26 we have made will greatly increase environmental protection while increasing the review time for a relatively small percentage of the total number of activities authorized each year. We have also become increasingly aware of the concerns that NWPs, particularly NWP 26, need to be modified to reflect regional differences in aquatic ecosystem functions and values and to more effectively reflect the desire of the states to develop partnerships to protect the aquatic environment. We, therefore, have directed our districts to carefully review all of the NWPs, particularly NWP 26, to revoke applicable NWPs in high value aquatic ecosystems, and to add regional conditions to limit the applicability of the NWPs to ensure that no more than minimal adverse effects occur in each district. We are also directing the districts to work with the states to develop mutually agreeable conditions that will result in a greater level of state Section 401 water quality certifications being issued for the NWPs. We are directing our districts to develop local procedures with their counterparts in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service which will ensure that the Corps bases its ``affect'' and ``jeopardy'' decisions on the best available information. We are also initiating formal programmatic consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act regarding the procedures associated with administering the NWP program. We believe that the changes described above, along with many others we have included in this reissuance of the NWPs, will substantially increase protection of the aquatic environment, ensure that no more than minimal adverse effects will occur, and maintain the regulatory flexibility necessary to administer a reasonable regulatory program.	 96-31645	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1996/12/13/96-31645/final-notice-of-issuance-reissuance-and-modification-of-nationwide-permits	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-12-13/pdf/96-31645.pdf	12/13/96

General Management Plan Revision, Environmental Impact Statement, Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona	Notice	Interior Department; National Park Service	Under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Park Service is preparing an environmental impact statement for the general management plan (GMP) revision for Petrified Forest National Park. The environmental impact statement will be approved by the Director, Intermountain Region. Petrified Forest National Park was established as a unit of the National Park System to preserve the mineralized remains of Mesozoic Forests (commonly known as the ``Petrified Forest''), additional features of scenic and scientific interest, and the area's natural environment and cultural resources, for public use and benefit. It is located in northeastern Arizona. The Petrified Forest National Park Final General Management Plan/Development Concept Plans/Environmental Impact Statement was approved in 1992. The new GMP revision will address new perspectives on several key elements that were not fully considered at the time of the plan: (1) The potential impact of building/expanding proposed new facilities into previously undeveloped areas, particularly the increased visibility of facilities from busy visitor areas and wilderness, was not comprehensively addressed in the existing GMP; (2) The existing GMP did not recognize that many existing structures have historic significance and warrant full evaluation for adaptive re-use rather than the proposed removal. Further, the planned arrangement of buildings, parking, courtyards, and trails comprise significant cultural landscapes which would have been substantially altered by the existing plan without recognition of these values. There is a much greater awareness now of cultural values that warrant revision of the plan, including historic structures, cultural landscapes, archeology, ethnography, and the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act; (3) It is unlikely that Petrified Forest National Park would receive the funding necessary to implement the proposals in the existing GMP; (4) The sustainability of proposing a lot of new construction versus the feasibility and sustainability of re-using existing structures was not adequately addressed in the existing plan; (5) More up-to-date information about handicapped accessibility is available; (6) Effectively preventing wood theft remains a very high priority, and more information on visitor behavior is now available; and (6) Bring plan into conformance with current NPS planning standards (NPS Director's Order 2). The National Park Service is planning to begin public scoping in November, 2000 via a newsletter to American Indian tribes, neighboring communities, county commissioners, organizations, state and federal agencies, researchers and institutions, the Congressional Delegation, and visitors who signed up to be on the mailing list. There will also be a web site and press releases. The purpose of the newsletter, web site, and press release is to explain the planning process and to obtain comments concerning revision of the GMP. Comments may be addressed to the Superintendent, and should be received no later that 60-days from the publication of this Notice of Intent.	 00-27476	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/10/31/00-27476/general-management-plan-revision-environmental-impact-statement-petrified-forest-national-park	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-10-31/pdf/00-27476.pdf	10/31/00
Refuge Planning Policy Pursuant to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act as Amended by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997	Notice	Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) establishes requirements and guidance for National Wildlife Refuge System planning, including Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCPs) and step-down management plans. This policy, which incorporates the CCP provisions of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, as amended, replaces Part 602 Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the Fish and Wildlife Service Manual. The new policy will appear as Part 602 Chapters 1, 3, and 4. Our policy for managing units of the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) is that we will manage all refuges in accordance with an approved CCP which, when implemented, will achieve refuge purposes; help fulfill the Refuge System mission; maintain and, where appropriate, restore the ecological integrity of each refuge and the Refuge System; help achieve the goals of the National Wilderness Preservation System; and meet other mandates. The CCP will guide management decisions and set forth goals, objectives, and strategies to accomplish these ends. We also may require step-down management plans to provide additional guidance for meeting CCP goals and objectives and to describe strategies and implementation schedules. Each plan will be consistent with principles of sound fish and wildlife management, available science, legal mandates, and our other policies, guidelines, and planning documents. We will prepare refuge plans that, above all else, ensure that wildlife comes first on national wildlife refuges.	 00-12931	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/25/00-12931/refuge-planning-policy-pursuant-to-the-national-wildlife-refuge-system-administration-act-as-amended	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-05-25/pdf/00-12931.pdf	5/25/00
Revision of HHS National Environmental Policy Act Compliance Procedures and Procedures for Environmental Protection	Notice	Health and Human Services Department	In accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, and other related environmental laws, executive orders, and regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services published procedures in 1980 for conducting environmental reviews, preparing necessary documentation and making program decisions to ensure that environmental protection is an integral part of HHS operations. These procedures have been revised and updated. The revised procedures were published in the January 11, 1999, Federal Register for comment. Changes recommended by EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality have been included in the final document.	 00-3631	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/02/25/00-3631/revision-of-hhs-national-environmental-policy-act-compliance-procedures-and-procedures-for	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-02-25/pdf/00-3631.pdf	2/25/00
Record of Decision: Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for Continued Operation of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM	Notice	Energy Department; National Nuclear Security Administration	The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Record of Decision (ROD) for the continued operation of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in Los Alamos, New Mexico. This ROD is based on information and analyses contained in the Final Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for the Continued Operation of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, DOE/EIS-0380 (Final SWEIS or 2008 SWEIS) issued on May 16, 2008; comments on the SWEIS; and other factors, including costs, security considerations and the missions of NNSA. In the 2008 SWEIS, NNSA assessed three alternatives for the continued operation of LANL: (1) No Action, (2) Reduced Operations, and (3) Expanded Operations. The No Action Alternative analyzed in this SWEIS consists of NNSA and LANL continuing to implement earlier decisions based on previous National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews, including the 1999 LANL SWEIS (DOE/EIS-0238) and its ROD (64 FR 50797, Sept. 20, 1999). The 2008 SWEIS identified the Expanded Operations Alternative as NNSA's Preferred Alternative. The SWEIS includes a classified appendix that assesses the potential environmental impacts of a representative set of credible terrorist scenarios. Because NNSA is continuing to evaluate significant technical and national security issues that could affect the operation and missions of LANL, NNSA is making only a few decisions at this time regarding the continued operation of the laboratory. NNSA will not make any decisions regarding nuclear weapons production and other actions analyzed in the Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0236-S4) (Complex Transformation SPEIS or SPEIS) prior to the completion of the SPEIS. However, NNSA must make some decisions now regarding LANL to support the safe and successful execution of the laboratory's current missions. It is likely that NNSA will issue other RODs regarding the continued operation of LANL based on the 2008 SWEIS, the SPEIS and other NEPA analyses. NNSA has decided to continue to implement the No Action Alternative with the addition of some elements of the Expanded Operations Alternative. These elements include increases in operation of some existing facilities and new facility projects needed for ongoing programs and protection of workers and the environment. For the most part, NNSA will continue the missions conducted at LANL at current levels at this time. NNSA will also continue to implement actions necessary to comply with the March 2005 Compliance Order on Consent (Consent Order), which requires investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at LANL. NNSA will not change pit production at LANL at this time; the 1999 ROD set pit production at LANL at 20 per year.

Adoption of Final Environmental and Historic Preservation Policies and Procedures	Notice	National Capital Planning Commission	On April 1, 2004, the National Capital Planning Commission adopted its updated and revised Environmental and Historic Preservation Policies and Procedures. The Policies and Procedures were originally adopted on September 13, 1979 and amended on September 3, 1981, October 21, 1982. The revised policies adopted on April 1, 2004 represent the first wholesale revisions and updating of the policies in over twenty years. A draft of the revised Policies and Procedures was originally published in the Federal Register for public comment on September 25, 2000. Following the receipt and consideration of comments, a revised draft was presented during an information presentation on the draft policies and procedures at the February 5, 2004 Commission meeting. Copies of the revised draft were made available for review on NCPC's Web site and upon request on December 29, 2003. In drafting the revised policies and procedures, NCPC consulted with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and took into consideration valuable input from members of the public who provided testimony and written comments early in the review process. In addition, NCPC considered the recommendations of the CEQ's September 2003 NEPA Task Force report ``Modernizing NEPA Implementation.'' The revised and updated policies and procedures update and clarify NCPC's existing environmental and historic preservation policies and procedures in the following significant areas: (1) Making more explicit the levels of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act required for each stage of NCPC's review of a project or master plan; (2) requiring a clearly defined NEPA scoping process; (3) expanding the public participation requirements during compliance with NEPA and Section 106; (4) integrating more closely the NEPA and Section 106 compliance processes; and (5) updating and revising NCPC's list of categorical exclusions under NEPA.	 04-15442	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/07/08/04-15442/adoption-of-final-environmental-and-historic-preservation-policies-and-procedures	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-07-08/pdf/04-15442.pdf	7/8/04

Record of Decision: Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/ Program Environmental Impact Report for the Sale of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 (Elk Hills), Kern County, California	Notice	Energy Department	The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Record of Decision to proceed, subject to review by Congress, with the sale to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) of all right, title, and interest of the United States in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 (NPR-1) located in Kern County, California, in accordance with Title XXXIV of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104-106 (hereinafter the ``Elk Hills Sales Statute'' or ``Act''). The Act requires that DOE undertake a process to sell NPR-1 in a manner consistent with commercial practices and in a manner that maximizes the proceeds to the Federal government. Furthermore, the Act requires DOE to complete the sale of NPR-1 by February 10, 1998, unless DOE and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) jointly determine that (i) the sale is proceeding in a manner inconsistent with achievement of a sale price that reflects full value, or (ii) another course of action is in the best interests of the United States. The Act also specifies a process for determining the minimum acceptable price for the sale of NPR-1. Based on the analyses in the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Program Environmental Impact Report (SEIS/PEIR) titled, ``Sale of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 (Elk Hills) Kern County, California,'' consideration of the Congressional direction contained in the Elk Hills Sales Statute, and an offer submitted by Occidental that exceeded the minimum acceptable sale price as determined pursuant to section 3412(d) of the Act and exceeded all other offers received following a competitive sales process, DOE has determined that implementation of the Proposed Action and Preferred Alternative in the SEIS/PEIR (i.e., the sale of all right, title and interest in NPR-1 in accordance with the Act to Occidental) is in the best interests of the United States. Accordingly, DOE is publishing this Record of Decision (ROD) under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 to proceed with the sale of NPR-1 to Occidental and to document the basis for this decision.	 97-33208	https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1997/12/19/97-33208/record-of-decision-supplemental-environmental-impact-statement-program-environmental-impact-report	https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-12-19/pdf/97-33208.pdf	12/19/97
